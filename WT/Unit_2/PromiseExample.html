<!-- 
    resolve is a function provided by the Promise constructor.
    When invoked, it signals that the asynchronous task,
    represented by the Promise, has been successfully completed and provides the resolved data.

    data is the value that the Promise resolves with.
    In this case, it's an object containing a message property.

    For instance, after performing an asynchronous task (like fetching data from an API or simulating a delay),
    resolve(data) is called to fulfill the Promise with the intended data.

    Once resolved, the .then() block associated with the Promise will execute,
    receiving the resolved data as an argument,
    allowing you to handle the successful outcome of the asynchronous operation.
