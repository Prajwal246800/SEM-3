<!-- 
    The readyState property represents the state of the XMLHttpRequest.
    When readyState is equal to 4,
    it means the operation (the request) has been completed,
    and the response data is available.

    Status Code 200 (OK): 
        This status code signifies that the request was successful.
        It's the standard response for successful HTTP requests,
        indicating that the server has fulfilled the request.

    Status Code 201 (Created):
        This status code indicates that a request has been fulfilled,
        and as a result, a new resource has been created on the server.
        It's often used in response to POST requests when a new resource,
        like a new entry in a database, has been successfully created.
